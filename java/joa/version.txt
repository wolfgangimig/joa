JOA Version History


- #3 Registry class did not read/write java.util.List correctly

- Do not focus the Java frame window after creation anymore. If the Java frame is 
  e.g. shown in a FormRegion of a new appointment form, the focus should start as
  usually in the subject line and not in the FormRegion.

0.4.0 2014-12-05

- Swing components can be integrated with JOA. Exception: JMenuBar cannot be used.

- View classes for JavaFX content were renamed and moved to package com.wilutions.joa.fx:
  TaskPaneFX, FolderViewFX, FormRegionFX, ModalDialogFX.
  
- Renamed the joa-with-dlls.jar to joa.jar. This should make it less likely to mix it up
  with joa-without-dlls.jar.
  
- Previous versions did not run on 32bit Windows.
